## Getting Started üöÄ

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) to be installed on your computer. 
```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio-template
```

If you don't have Git installed or you don't like using the terminal then you can download the [zip](https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio-template/archive/master.zip) and extract that and open the extracted folder in the code editor of your your choice.

## Editing the Template üî®

Go to `index.html` and fill your information. 

### Header

In all of the places where you're supposed to fill your information you'll find HTML comments. As shown below just replace what is already in the opening and closing tags below the comment with your information.

```html
<div class="header__text-box row">
    <div class="header__text">
        <h1 class="heading-primary">
        <!-- Replace the following name with your name -->
        <span>Fix My Computer</span>
        </h1>
        <!-- Put a small paragraph about yourself -->
        <p>A Company based in Stockholm, Sweden .</p>
        <a href="#contact" class="btn btn--pink">Get in touch</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Work Section

Each div with class `work__box` represents a project, replace the contents of the all the tags with the information of your projects.

```html
<div class="work__box">
    <div class="work__text">
    <h3>Our Services</h3>
    <p>
        we provide the best IT solution for everyone.
    </p>
    <ul class="work__list">
        <li>Software Consultation</li>
        <li>Data recovery</li>
        <li>Performance</li>
        <li>Software subscription & recommendation</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="work__links">
        <a href="#" class="link__text">
        Visit Site <span>&rarr;</span>
        </a> 
        <a href="https://github.com/crazyslim021/portfolio" target="_blank">
        <img src="./images/github.svg" class="work__code" alt="GitHub">
        </a>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="work__image-box">
        <img
            src="./images/project-1.png"
            class="work__image"
            alt="Project 1"
        />
    </div>
</div>
```

For changing the screenshot:
- first place the image in `images/` folder and then in HTML replace the name in `src` with the name of your image.

- Recommended size for project image (1366 x 767px) also make sure the size of all  project images is the same.

```html
<img
    src="./images/name-of-your-image.png"
    class="work__image"
    alt="Project 1"
/>
```

### Clients Section

- Place the logos of the clients and companies that you have worked with in `images/` directory and then replace the name in `src` with the name of your logos accordingly.

- Make sure that you don't have whitespace on either side of the logos.

```html
<img
    src="./images/your-logo.png"
    class="client__logo"
    alt="Your Logo"
/>
```

### About Section

- Replace the contents in the below paragraph with information about yourself.
- Place a nice photo of yourself in the `images/` directory and then change the name in the src with your image name.

```html
<section class="about" id="about">
    <div class="row">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="about__content">
